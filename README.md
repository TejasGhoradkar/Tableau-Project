# Tableau-Project

● Top 10 products by sales amount: This will allow you to see which products are
generating the most revenue for the company.
● Top 10 customers: This will help you identify your most valuable customers, and allow
you to focus on providing them with excellent customer service and building long-term
relationships.
● Sales figures vs. budget: You could create a chart or table that compares your actual
sales figures to your budgeted sales figures for each month. This will help you identify
any months where you're falling short of your goals, and allow you to take action to
improve performance.
● Sales figures by region/city: If you have multiple store locations, you could create a
chart or map that shows sales figures by region. This will help you identify any regional
trends or opportunities for growth.
● Product categories vs. sales amount: Creating a chart or graph that shows product
category vs. sales will give you an overview of how each product category is performing.
This can help you identify which categories are generating the most revenue for the
company and which ones need more attention.
● add other information to the dashboard to show your creativity, also
create a story instead of dashboard.
